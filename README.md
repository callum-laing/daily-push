# 📝 daily-push

**A personal blog CMS to track my web development journey — built with Nuxt.**

---

## 📘 Overview

I wanted a simple, lightweight way to log my daily progress as a developer — not in a Notion doc, not in Markdown files, but something I built and use every day.

I looked around for tools that fit my workflow and felt _just right_. Nothing quite did. So... I built it myself.

The goal of **daily-push** is simple:

- ✅ Log daily wins, struggles, and lessons
- ✅ Add entries through a clean, admin-only interface (no more writing posts in the code)
- ✅ Build consistency, reflection, and momentum — all while improving my dev skills

This project started with a question:

> _“How can I keep myself accountable with my learning?”_
